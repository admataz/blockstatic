<p>I originally wrote this in 2011 for a previous version of admataz.com to keep my efforts on track. Reviewing it again now in 2015,  admataz has grown into a more formal business entity and I am working more directly with clients as opposed to daily freelance contract work.   I think this is still relevant to my approach to this site. </p>
<h3 id="this-is-my-web-site-and-here-s-the-thinking-behind-it-">This is my web site, and hereâ€™s the thinking behind it:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Original</strong>. The site reflects and records my ongoing ideas, expressions and professional work. This means regular subjective updates to the site content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Experimental</strong>. The site code is created by me, using self-made tools over libraries and frameworks where I can. My personal site is an opportunity for learning, experimentation with my craft and developing core skills. This means regular unstable additions to the site functionality. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal and progressive</strong>. The site design, features and technology only contain what is needed. This means less structure, navigation and technical capacity. It also means less bloat. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Open</strong>. When I produce original code for this site, I expose it, explain it and share it. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Incomplete</strong>. It&#39;s never finished because there&#39;s always space for growth and new ideas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mine</strong>. I am not a client or employer. I can do what I like, break the rules and be inefficient. </p>
</li>
</ol>
